# Assignments_labs

Hello, I am Yahya Efe Kuru√ßay.

I am a computer engineering student at Akdeniz University.

This repo contains the programming assignments I have completed in my Akdeniz University laboratory courses.

The assignments are written in a variety of programming languages.

For more information about the content of the assignments and the technologies I used, 
please see the README files (generally there are pdf's in the folders)for the respective assignments.

I am sharing this repo for other students who are looking to improve their programming skills.

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me at efekurucay.com.

Thank you.
2023.
